A <E>category</E> in the mathematical sence (not a &GAP; category) is
a collection of objects, such that for each pair of objects, there is
a set of morphisms between them.  Morphisms can be composed whenever
this gives sence, and for the pair <M>(X, X)</M> of objects, there is
a special morphism called the identity morphism. <P />

A category is called <E>additive</E> if, for any pair of objects
<M>(X,Y)</M>, the set of morphisms from <M>X</M> to <M>Y</M> is an
abelian group such that composition distributes over addition;
moreover there is a special ``zero object'' in the category with only
the zero morphism between itself and other objects; and the concept of
direct sums with associated inclusions and projections. <P />

Finally, an additive category is called <E>abelian</E> if every
morphism in the category has a kernel and a cokernel; any monomorphism
in the cateogory is the kernel of its cokernel; any epimorphism in the
category is the cokernel of its kernel. Kernels and cokernels in a
general abelian category is defined by a universal factorization
property.<P />

In &Complex;, there are &GAP; categories for each of the three types
of categories mentioned above.  In practice, the only category the
user will ever come in contact with is the last --
<C>IsAbelianCat</C>.  Nevertheless, all three categories are
thoroughly docoumented in the following section.
