Bounded and repeating complexes

The chain complexes it is easiest to get information about are those
where all differentials can be looked up without compuations.  The
only method for constructing half infinite lists (and hence;
complexes) which fulfills this requirement is the ``repeating''
method.  By a repeating complex we mean a complex where both the
negative and positive part is repeating. <P />

A special type of repeating complexes are the <E>bounded
complexes</E>.  A complex <M>C</M> is <E>bounded above</E>
(resp. <E>bounded below</E>) if there is a bound <M>b</M> such that
<M>C_i = 0</M> for all <M>i > b</M> (resp. for all <M>i &lt; b</M>). We
say that a chain complex is bounded if it is both bounded above and
bounded below. <P />

Note that any complex constructed by <Ref Func="ZeroComplex" />, <Ref
Func="StalkComplex" />, <Ref Func="BoundedComplex" /> and <Ref
Func="ShortExactSequence" /> are bounded complexes.
